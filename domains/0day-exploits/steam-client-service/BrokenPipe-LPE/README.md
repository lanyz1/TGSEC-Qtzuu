# What is BrokenPipe?

BrokenPipe demonstrates a local privilege escalation from a standard Windows account to
`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` through the Steam Client Service. The proof launches an interactive SYSTEM
command prompt without requesting administrator credentials or displaying a UAC prompt.

## What the screenshot above proves

- BrokenPipe was launched by a standard Windows user.
- Steam was open at its unauthenticated login screen.
- The resulting command prompt ran as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- `whoami /user` returned the Local System SID, `S-1-5-18`.
- No game was launched.



## Technical summary

The Steam Client Service (`steamservice.exe`), which always runs as SYSTEM, accepts a caller-controlled installation root that is not covered by the
signature of a genuine Valve-signed install-script VDF. BrokenPipe uses this signature-coverage gap
to make the privileged service execute the included launcher from a relocated path as SYSTEM. It
does not forge, modify, or bypass the VDF signature.

Pipeline:

The proof was validated against the current version of Steam `10.96.30.42` on the latest versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 x64.

## Build

Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2022
- Desktop development with C++ workload
- MSVC v143
- Windows 10 or Windows 11 SDK

Open PowerShell in the project directory and run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1
```

The finished executable is written to:

```text
x64\Release\BrokenPipe.exe
```

The build script finds MSBuild, verifies the embedded payload hash, rebuilds the x64 Release
configuration, and prints the final executable path and SHA-256.

You can also open `BrokenPipe.sln` in Visual Studio, select `Release | x64`, and choose
**Build > Rebuild Solution**.

## Usage

1. Sign in as a standard Windows user.
2. Start Steam and leave it idle. A Steam account login is not required.
3. Do not open a game.
4. Run `BrokenPipe.exe` normally, without elevation.
5. Verify the new SYSTEM prompt with `whoami` or `whoami /user` or whatever other command you want to run.
6. Type `exit` or close the SYSTEM prompt when finished.

No command-line arguments or external runtime files are required. The payload ZIP is compiled into
the executable. The proof creates no persistence, launches only the canonical
`C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`, and places the elevated process tree in a kill-on-close Windows job.
JSON receipts are written to `C:\Users\Public\BrokenPipe`.

If you want to make adjustments to the payload used, it is located in the payloads folder with the name `BrokenPipePayload.zip`

## Source layout

```text
BrokenPipe\
  assets\
    brokenpipe-system-shell.png
  payload\
    BrokenPipePayload.zip
  BrokenPipe-Bootstrap.ps1
  BrokenPipe.cpp
  BrokenPipe.rc
  BrokenPipe.sln
  BrokenPipe.vcxproj
  build.ps1
  resource.h
  README.md
```

The embedded payload must remain at `payload\BrokenPipePayload.zip` unless its resource path is also
updated in `BrokenPipe.rc`.

## FAQ

Q: __What is this__
<br>
A: <i>A Standard User -> SYSTEM Local Privilege Escalation</i>
<br>
<br>
Q: __How does it work?__
A: <i>Look into `Payload\BrokenPipePayload.zip`, unzip it and read the code.</i>
<br>
<br>
Q: __Isn't it useless?__
<br>
A: <i>For you, maybe, for others, probably not.</i>
<br>
<br>
Q: __What's so bad about it__
<br>
A: <i>You're gaining SYSTEM privileges, it's a tier higher than Administrator (what you right click and select) and a tier lower than TRUSTEDINSTALLER without actually being an admin in the first place. If you don't understand this, Google it (or ask your friendly neighborhood LLM such as Grok, ChatGPT or Siri lmao)</i>
<br>
<br>
Q: __Why?__
<br>
A: <i>Cuz VALVE already knows about it since March, they haven't fixed it and merely because I don't care about Steam or any VALVE games especially when CS2 is ridden with cheaters and exploiters. They should fix it and look into that 5 month old report.</i>
<br>
<br>
Q: __Some stupid Standard Admin Install question or whatever that someone gave that gave me slight brain cell loss...__
<br>
A: <i>Even your antivirus needs admin rights when you're installing it, installing Steam of course requires admin rights on the first install. After that it just runs the service as SYSTEM even for a standard user. Don't ask me, ask VALVE.</i>
