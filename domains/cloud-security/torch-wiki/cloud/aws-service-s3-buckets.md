# AWS - Service - S3 Buckets

## What it is

An AWS S3 bucket is a cloud-based storage container that holds files, known as objects, which can be accessed over the internet. It is highly scalable and can store large amounts of data, such as documents, images, and backups. S3 provides robust security through access control, encryption, and permissions management. It ensures high durability and availability, making it ideal for storing and retrieving data from anywhere.

## How it works

S3 buckets may be publicly readable due to misconfigured bucket ACLs, bucket policies granting `s3:GetObject` to `*`, or disabled Block Public Access settings, exposing stored data to unauthenticated access. Attackers enumerate bucket names via DNS brute-forcing, metadata scraping, and the AWS CLI, then probe for public read and write access. Writable public buckets can be abused for malware hosting, web cache poisoning, or to plant files that are subsequently processed by privileged backend services.

## Attack phases

- **Exploitation**: primary phase for this note (credential and control-plane abuse)
- **Adjacent phases**: overlaps are common once credentials or lateral paths appear

## Prerequisites

Authorized scope covering the depicted systems; valid credentials or network reach as required by each command block inside the methodology body.

```ps1
sudo apt install awscli
```

```python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3',aws_access_key_id='AKIAJQDP3RKREDACTED',aws_secret_access_key='igH8yFmmpMbnkcUaCqXJIRIozKVaREDACTED',region_name='us-west-1')

try:
 result = s3.list_buckets()
 print(result)
except Exception as e:
 print(e)
```

## Credentials and Profiles

Create a profile with your `AWSAccessKeyId` and `AWSSecretKey`, then you can use `--profile nameofprofile` in the `aws` command.

```js
aws configure --profile nameofprofile
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <AWSAccessKeyId>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <AWSSecretKey>
Default region name [None]: 
Default output format [None]: 
```

Alternatively you can use environment variables instead of creating a profile.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIAZ[...]PODP56
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=fPk/Gya[...]4/j5bSuhDQ
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=FQoGZXIvYXdzE[...]8aOK4QU=
```

## Public S3 Bucket

An open S3 bucket refers to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that has been configured to allow public access, either intentionally or by mistake. This means that anyone on the internet could potentially access, read, or even modify the data stored in the bucket, depending on the permissions set.

* `http://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>`
* `http://<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com`
* `https://<bucket-name>.region.amazonaws.com/<file>`

AWS S3 buckets name examples: [http://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com](http://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com).

Either bruteforce the buckets name with keyword related to your target or search through the leaked one using OSINT tool such as [buckets.grayhatwarfare.com](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/).

When file listing is enabled, the name is also displayed inside the `<Name>` XML tag.

```xml
<ListBucketResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<Name>adobe-REDACTED-REDACTED-REDACTED</Name>
```

## Bucket Interations

### Find the Region

To find the region of an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service (such as an S3 bucket) using dig or nslookup, query the DNS records for the service's domain or endpoint.

```bash
$ dig flaws.cloud
;; ANSWER SECTION:
flaws.cloud.    5    IN    A    52.218.192.11

$ nslookup 52.218.192.11
Non-authoritative answer:
11.192.218.52.in-addr.arpa name = s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.
```

### List Files

To list files in an AWS S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, you can use the following command:

```bash
aws s3 ls <target> [--options]
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name --no-sign-request --region <insert-region-here>
aws s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud/ --no-sign-request --region us-west-2
```

### Copy, Upload and Download Files

* **Copy**

```bash
aws s3 cp <source> <target> [--options]
aws s3 cp local.txt s3://bucket-name/remote.txt --acl authenticated-read
aws s3 cp login.html s3://bucket-name --grants read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers
```

* **Upload**

```bash
aws s3 mv <source> <target> [--options]
aws s3 mv test.txt s3://hackerone.files
SUCCESS : "move: ./test.txt to s3://hackerone.files/test.txt"
```

* **Download**

```bash
aws s3 sync <source> <target> [--options]
aws s3 sync s3://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud/ . --no-sign-request --region us-west-2
```

### List File Versions

When versioning is enabled in an AWS S3 bucket, list file history using the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <bucket-name> [--options]
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <bucket-name> --prefix <file-path>
```

### Download a Specific File Version

```bash
aws s3api get-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key <source> --version-id <id> <target>
```

## Bypasses and variants

Enumerate case-specific bypasses inside the methodologies above when upstream documented alternate paths.

## Detection and defence

Apply vendor baselines for logging, least privilege, patch cadence, and segmentation. Map signals to SOC playbooks relevant to each platform referenced in this page.

## Tools

Tool references are inline in **Methodology**; see the `tools/` pages for CLI usage.


## Disambiguate "created a bucket" from "wrote a key" using S3 naming rules alone
S3/MinIO bucket names must be 3-63 characters, lowercase, and contain no underscore. If an anonymous PUT/upload succeeds with a first path-segment that violates any of these rules (uppercase letters, an underscore, or fewer than 3 characters), that segment cannot be a real bucket: the write necessarily landed as an object-key prefix inside an existing bucket, not a newly created bucket. Use this to prove or refute a "this created a rogue bucket" claim purely from the naming rules, with no bucket-listing permission needed. Gotcha: the store's own AccessDenied/error XML echoing that first segment back in a `<BucketName>` field is just the server parsing the URL path, not evidence a bucket by that name exists.
