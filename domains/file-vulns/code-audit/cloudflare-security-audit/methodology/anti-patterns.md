## Anti-patterns

1. Checklist deviations presented as vulnerabilities.
2. Defense-in-depth advice with no reachable boundary violation.
3. Live or shared-environment testing where bounded local evidence is insufficient.
4. Guessing provider, proxy, browser, identity, or deployment behavior not present in source.
5. Treating intended same-principal authority or self-impact as a cross-boundary result.
6. Reporting a parser or runtime effect stronger than the observed effect.
7. Emitting prose-only hunter results that cannot be deduplicated or verified.
8. Re-reporting carried same-source prior confirmed records or using them as exemplars that anchor the hunt.
9. Assigning severity to `needs_validation` records.
10. Writing the report before independent verification or letting prose and JSON disagree.
