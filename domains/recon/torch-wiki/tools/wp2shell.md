## Purpose

`wp2shell` is a standalone PoC that chains a **WordPress REST batch route-confusion SQL injection**
into an administrator account, then deploys a webshell plugin for command execution as the web user.
It automates the full path from an unauthenticated (or low-privilege) WordPress target to RCE.

> Reference entry only. This page documents WHAT the tool does and HOW to invoke it, not the
> exploit internals (the SQLi primitive, the plugin webshell source). Read the repo for those.

## When to reach for it

- A WordPress target where the version fingerprint is old/spoofed and the REST API is reachable.
- You already hold WordPress admin creds and want a one-command webshell (it also supports an
  authenticated `shell` mode, not just the pre-auth bridge).
- Fingerprint via [[wiki/tools/wpscan]] first; if the build is in range, `wp2shell` is the quick-win RCE.

## Install / setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Icex0/wp2shell-poc /home/kali/wp2shell-poc
cd /home/kali/wp2shell-poc
python3 wp2shell.py --help
```

## Usage

```bash
# confirm the vulnerability (non-destructive), single URL or a file of URLs
python3 wp2shell.py check http://target

# read from the DB via blind SQLi
python3 wp2shell.py read http://target

# RCE: with admin creds, or via the pre-auth bridge (omit --user/--password to use the bridge)
python3 wp2shell.py shell --user <admin> --password '<pass>' --cmd 'id; hostname' http://target
python3 wp2shell.py shell -i http://target            # interactive shell after deploy
```

## Notes / gotchas

- The `shell` mode deploys a webshell **plugin that self-cleans after each `--cmd`** - each
  invocation is one-shot (fine for enumeration; for a persistent session, drop an SSH key or a
  reverse shell from within the first `--cmd`).
- Default request `--timeout` (15s) is often too short on a loaded target; pass `--timeout 60`.
- The bridge/`shell` mode creates a throwaway admin (e.g. `wp2_<hex>`); note it for cleanup.
- WordPress `http-generator` version can be **spoofed** - do not trust it; if `wp2shell check`
  confirms, the build is vulnerable regardless of the advertised version.
