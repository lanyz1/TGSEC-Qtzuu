# Auto-Triggers: what fires automatically, and when

What the framework fires on its own, so you know what activates for a given task.

**Core principle:** auto-triggers **inject context** (a suggestion the model reads and acts on, or a warning). They do **not** silently run commands. Every fire is a visible injected line. Nothing executes a tool by itself.

> **During a campaign, the driver supersedes these advisory triggers.** Running an engagement under `Skill(bb-workflow|pt-workflow|ctf-workflow)` puts `scripts/campaign.py` in charge: it prints the next required action (wiki-first, tool-first, skill-first, typed evidence) as tool output every turn, which is *enforced* rather than suggested. The hooks below still fire and remain the routing layer for **ad-hoc, non-campaign** work; inside a campaign, follow the driver's `next` block over any hook nudge. Retiring the now-redundant hooks is deliberately deferred: they are harmless and still serve non-campaign work.

**Source of truth** (edit these, not this doc, to change behaviour):
- keyword -> skill: `skills/hunt/triggers.json`
- tech fingerprint -> tests: `scripts/playbook.json`
- finding class -> pivot: `scripts/chains.json` (ingested by `next_move.py`, keyed by finding class; candidates never auto-fire, suggestions only)
- hook logic: `skills/hooks/*.py`
- hook registration (per device): `setup/install-hooks.sh` -> `~/.claude/settings.json`

This page is a snapshot; regenerate the tables from those files if they change.

## What fires, and when

| Event | Hook(s) | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **SessionStart** | `session-start.sh`, `engagement-init.py` | Loads `session/hot.md`; injects the active-engagement summary + top next-moves + recent log + wiki-health line (only if broken) + active research status (`research_status.py`); regenerates `index.md` if stale; self-heals the engagement file set. |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | `hunt-trigger.py` | Keyword-matches the prompt against `triggers.json` (code-stripped, intent-gated): a hard hit surfaces the relevant **Skill(x)** to load (routing; the skill carries the mandate), a surface hit a softer "consider Skill(x)". Leak-safe telemetry to `.trigger-fire.jsonl`. |
| **PreToolUse (Bash)** | `scope-guard.py` | ENFORCES: denies an out-of-scope host/IP (CIDR-aware) or RoE-forbidden tooling; fail-open, `.enforce-off` downgrades to advisory (deterministic safety guard). |
| **PreToolUse (Write)** | `session-guard.py` | Warns when a write would put a client marker into a generic `session/*` file OR a git-tracked framework tree (`wiki/`, `scripts/`, `skills/`, `docs/`, `tests/`, `setup/`); `targets/` and `docs/superpowers/` are exempt. Catches the codename-in-a-tracked-file leak at write-time. |
| **PostToolUse (Bash)** | `recon-capture.py` | Fingerprint auto-route (to the hunt Skill) + OOB callback correlation + a once-per-engagement GATE-1 wiki-first nudge (exploit-shaped command while `Approach.md` Weaponize is undone). A framework-meta guard suppresses false fires. Advisory. |
| **PostToolUse (all)** | `tool-telemetry.py` | Per-box telemetry: appends every tool/skill call to `targets/<eng>/.events.jsonl`, stamps `started_at`, records the transcript path; feeds `eval_metrics.py`. Silent, fail-open. |
| **PostToolUse (Bash)** | `capture-poc.py` | Appends every meaningful command + its output to `targets/<eng>/poc/cmdlog/<tool>.md` (grouped by the inner binary, vm.sh-unwrapped), so the operator has a readable per-tool record with no manual capture. Skips framework/dev commands + empty output; capped; fail-open. |
| **PostToolUse (Write/Edit)** | `wiki-reindex.py` | Auto-reindex: a Write/Edit to `wiki/**/*.md` fires a debounced background `qmd update`, so the change is searchable without a manual reindex. Off the blocking path, fail-open. |
| **PreCompact** | `pre-compact.sh` | Reminds to persist state (`gsd:pause-work`) before context compacts. |
| **Stop** | `close-out.py` | Close-out reflex: when the engagement is SOLVED but its walkthrough is unassembled (or the learn harvest is due), nudges Skill(walkthrough) then Skill(learn). Advisory, self-clearing. |

All 12 hooks (across 6 events) inject context, route to a skill, capture telemetry, or fire a deterministic safety guard; none prescribes methodology, none launches a scan, and all fail open. `scope-guard` denies an out-of-scope/RoE-forbidden command and `drift-guard` denies an off-board exploit call after repeated ignores (escalating from a warning); the rest only inject context. Canonical set: `scripts/check-hooks.py` `EXPECTED_HOOKS`. (Removed 2026-08-04: `web-recon.py`, which auto-launched `recon-web.sh` + a chromium page render on every newly-seen in-scope surface. It fired on tool OUTPUT, so merely PRINTING a hostname re-launched scans and a render against hosts already retired, and the render leg was producing empty `poc/` dirs rather than evidence. Run `scripts/recon-web.sh <eng> <url>` by hand instead.)

52 triggers total (42 vuln-type + 10 attack-surface). xxe/ssti/graphql route to hunt-injection (no separate skills). azure ad -> hunt-m365 (not hunt-cloud) by design. (Counts drift as `triggers.json` grows; recount with `python3 -c "import json;d=json.load(open('skills/hunt/triggers.json'));print(len(d['triggers']),len(d['surface_triggers']))"`.)

## 3. What you RUN -> command-time triggers

### Before the command: scope/RoE enforcement (`scope-guard.py`, PreToolUse)
**ENFORCES: denies the command** (`.enforce-off` marker downgrades it to an advisory warning) when the command:
- targets an out-of-scope host/IP (CIDR-aware: `10.0.3.9` caught by out-of-scope `10.0.3.0/24`), or
- uses RoE-forbidden tooling given `scope.md` flags: `no_bruteforce` (hydra/medusa/kerbrute/...), `no_dos` (slowloris/--min-rate huge/nmap -T5/...), `passive_only` (any active scanner).

Fails open: a missing scope entry = no denial. No active engagement = silent.

### After a bash command: fingerprint router + OOB correlation + GATE-1 nudge (`recon-capture.py`, PostToolUse)

**Fingerprint auto-route** - scans the command + its output for tech and injects the hunt skill to fire. A framework-meta guard suppresses false fires when the command reads/edits the vault's own playbook/hook/wiring machinery (its output is full of playbook tokens). Detected tech (from `playbook.json`):

```
graphql  spring  supabase  wordpress  laravel  next.js  firebase  magento
jenkins  tomcat  gitlab  elasticsearch  influxdb  redis  mssql  jwt  oauth  s3
azure  fortigate  kubernetes  docker  swagger  ldap  smb  x-cache  mongodb
confluence  drupal  joomla  grafana  phpmyadmin  weblogic  iis  struts  jira
llm  mcp  github actions  grpc  exchange  ivanti  moveit  sharepoint  activemq
coldfusion  php-cgi  vcenter  screenconnect  papercut  ofbiz
```
(80 fingerprints. Each emits the hunt skill to load, e.g. `jenkins detected -> load Skill(hunt-rce)`. The tech list above is an illustrative subset; regenerate from `playbook.json`.)

**OOB callback correlation** - flips a waiting `oob.md` row to HIT when its planted token appears in the command + output blob (operator polling OAST/Collaborator), so a confirmed blind-bug callback is surfaced immediately instead of being missed.

**GATE-1 wiki-first nudge** - the only enforcement the plan board's GATE lines get. When an exploit-shaped command runs (`sqlmap`/`hydra`/`medusa`/`msfconsole`/`evil-winrm`/`nxc ... -x`/a reverse shell, incl. inside a vm.sh/ssh/wsl wrapper) while the active `Approach.md` `## 2. Weaponize` section has no `[~]`/`[x]` progress, it nudges once per engagement to query the wiki + pick the payload + mark the Weaponize item BEFORE hand-rolling. Fire-once (`.gate1-nudged` marker), framework-meta exempt, advisory + fail-open.

Tools whose output is fingerprinted (matched at command position, including inside `vm.sh`/`ssh`/`wsl` bridge wrappers): `nmap masscan nxc netexec crackmapexec ffuf httpx subfinder rustscan naabu dnsx katana gau amass gowitness arjun nuclei gobuster feroxbuster curl wget whatweb wpscan nikto nslookup dig sqlmap dalfox swaks`. (Capturing results into `state.md`/`loot.md` is now state-first discipline, not a hook nudge.)

**`fuzz` skill routing** - three independent paths, no single point of failure: typed discovery vocabulary (`fuzz`, `vhost`, `hidden param`, ...) hits `triggers.json` `surface_triggers` (§2); a live recon gap fires one of `recon-capture.py`'s two content-discovery nudges (RECON COMPLETENESS when a web probe ran but discovery didn't, and the new-surface-class nudge after a foothold); and a precise discoverable-surface signal (dir listing, robots `Disallow`, swagger/openapi) in `playbook.json` routes straight to `Skill(fuzz)` rather than a generic "http service" fingerprint.

## By task - concrete examples

| You do | Auto-fires |
|---|---|
| type "test login.x.com for sql injection" | hunt-sqli (wiki query + payloads) |
| run `nmap -sV host` -> output shows Jenkins + GraphQL | router: jenkins + graphql detected -> load hunt-rce / hunt-injection |
| run `hydra ...` with `no_bruteforce: true` in scope | scope-guard denies the command (before run) |
| run `nmap 10.0.3.9` where `10.0.3.0/24` is out of scope | scope-guard denies the command |
| type "solve this crackme" | ctf-category -> reverse-engineering page + radare2/pwntools |
| type "what next" | next-move (ranked moves) |
| start a session on an engagement | engagement-init: state + top-3 next moves + wiki health |

## How you know it fired

Every trigger prints a visible line the model then acts on:
- `MANDATORY ... load Skill(<skill>)` (hard keyword hit) / `consider Skill(<skill>)` (surface hit)
- `Fingerprint auto-route (playbook.json) ...` (a recon command found tech)
- a `scope-guard` block with the scope/RoE reason (deterministic deny; a `SCOPE/RoE ADVISORY` line instead when `.enforce-off` is set)
- `=== Engagement state ===` (session start)

Nothing runs a command on its own. To change what fires: edit `triggers.json` (keywords), `playbook.json` (fingerprints + tests), or the hook `.py` files; re-run `bash setup/install-hooks.sh` only when adding a new hook event.
