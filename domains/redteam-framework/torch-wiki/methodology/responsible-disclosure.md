## What it is

The process of reporting a discovered vulnerability to the vendor, coordinating a fix, and getting a **CVE** assigned and an advisory published, ethically and legally. This is what turns a finding from the `research` skill into a credential: published CVEs are the currency of a security-research reputation.

## How it works

Coordinated disclosure keeps the bug private while the vendor builds a fix, then publishes once users can patch. A **CVE ID** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is issued by a **CNA** (CVE Numbering Authority) - the vendor if they are one, otherwise a third-party CNA or MITRE as the CNA of last resort.

## Attack phases
Reporting / post-research (after a finding is proven and novel - see the `research` skill, step 7-8).

## Prerequisites
- A **proven, reproducible** finding with affected versions, impact, and a minimal PoC (research `findings.md`).
- Confirmed **novelty** (not already a known/fixed CVE).

## Methodology

### 1. Package the report
Title, affected + tested versions, vuln class (CWE), CVSS vector + score, clear reproduction steps, minimal PoC, impact, suggested remediation, and your contact. No real victim data; redact anything sensitive.

### 2. Find the contact (in order)
```
/.well-known/security.txt   (RFC 9116: contact, encryption, policy)
SECURITY.md in the repo;  security@<vendor>;  vendor PSIRT page
Bug bounty platform (HackerOne/Bugcrowd) if the vendor runs one
GitHub: private vulnerability reporting / Security Advisory (for OSS repos)
No response -> CERT/CC (kb.cert.org) coordinates on your behalf
```

### 3. Report privately
Send the package over the stated channel; encrypt with the vendor PGP key if published. Be specific, professional, non-extortive. Offer to clarify and to validate the fix.

### 4. Coordinate a timeline
Agree a disclosure date - **90 days** is the common industry default (Project Zero). Stay responsive; re-confirm the fix when shipped. Escalate to CERT/CC if the vendor goes silent past the deadline.

### 5. Request the CVE
```
Vendor is a CNA            -> they assign the CVE in their advisory.
OSS on GitHub              -> open a GitHub Security Advisory; GitHub (a CNA) issues the CVE (GHSA + CVE).
Third-party CNA covers it  -> request via that CNA (e.g. a program's platform).
None of the above          -> MITRE CVE Request form (cveform.mitre.org), CNA of last resort.
```
Provide: product, affected versions, vuln type (CWE), impact, and a reference. The ID is **RESERVED**, then **PUBLISHED** with details after disclosure.

### 6. Publish the advisory
After the fix (or the agreed deadline), publish: title, CVE ID, affected/fixed versions, CWE, CVSS vector, description, PoC, impact, remediation, timeline, and credit. Mirror to your blog / GitHub for the portfolio.

## Bypasses and variants
- **Disclosure models:** coordinated/responsible (private -> fix -> public, default); full disclosure (public immediately - last resort against an unresponsive/hostile vendor); non-disclosure (private only).
- **Bounty vs CVE:** a bug bounty pays but may forbid public disclosure; a CVE builds public reputation. Some programs allow both - check the policy.

## Detection and defence
Vendor side: publish a `security.txt` + `SECURITY.md`, run a PSIRT/VDP, become a CNA, and patch within the agreed window.

## Legal and ethics (read first)
Stay within scope and the program's **safe-harbor** terms. Do not access/exfiltrate real user data, pivot, or persist beyond proving impact. Unauthorized testing can violate the CFAA (US) / Computer Misuse Act (UK) / equivalent - no authorization, no testing. Never extort ("pay or I publish").

## Tools
`security.txt`, FIRST CVSS calculator, CWE list, PGP/age (encrypted reports), CVE/NVD + GHSA search (novelty + references). Driven by the `disclosure` skill; findings come from the `research` skill. Report quality: [[vulnerability-reports]], [[vuln-assessment]].

## Availability-incident protocol: disclose regardless of outcome

If a live target starts failing (timeouts, 5xx, connection resets) during testing and the timing
correlates with a specific probe class, stop touching that target immediately, do not keep testing
to "confirm the chain" while the outage is unresolved.

Assess honestly rather than defensively: correlation with your own request timing is real evidence
even when total request volume looks too low to plausibly cause it. The correct position is
"unknown causation, real correlation", not "not my fault" and not "definitely my fault", either
overclaim damages credibility with the operator.

Disclose to the operator BEFORE submitting any findings from that target, with the observation and
timeline. If the target recovers on its own before contact is made, disclose anyway and note the
recovery, an unattended recovery is evidence for a different cause, not permission to stay quiet.
