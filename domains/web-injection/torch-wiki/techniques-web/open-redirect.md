## What it is

A vulnerability where an application accepts a user-controlled URL as a redirect target without validating that it points to an allowed domain, allowing attackers to redirect victims to malicious sites.

## How it works

Applications often redirect users after login, logout, OAuth flows, or link-click tracking using a `next`, `redirect`, `url`, or `return_to` parameter. When the target URL is not validated against an allowlist, an attacker can supply an external URL.

## Attack phases

Exploitation — often chained with phishing, OAuth token theft, or SSRF.

## Methodology

1. Find redirect parameters: `?next=`, `?redirect=`, `?url=`, `?return_to=`, `?returnUrl=`, `?goto=`
2. Test with external URL: `?next=https://evil.com`
3. Try bypasses if blocked: `//evil.com`, `\/\/evil.com`, `https:evil.com`, URL encoding, subdomains (`evil.com.target.com`)
4. Check OAuth `redirect_uri` — open redirect here = token theft
5. Look for redirect in `Location:` headers after POST actions

## Filter Bypass Techniques

- **CRLF injection** to bypass `javascript:` blacklist: `java%0d%0ascript%0d%0a:alert(0)`
- **Using `//`, `\/\/`, `https:`** to bypass `http` or `//` filters: `\/\/google.com/`
- **Null byte** or **Ideographic Full Stop**: `//google%00.com` or `//google%E3%80%82com`
- **Using `@` character**: `http://www.theirsite.com@yoursite.com/`
- **Using `?` character**: `http://www.yoursite.com?http://www.theirsite.com/` (browser translates it to `/?`)
- **Host/Split Unicode Normalization**: `https://evil.c℀.example.com` normalizes to `https://evil.ca/c.example.com`
- **Creating folder as domain**: `http://www.yoursite.com/http://www.theirsite.com/`

## Key payloads / examples

```
?next=https://evil.com
?next=//evil.com
?next=\/\/evil.com
?redirect_uri=https://evil.com%2F@legitimate.com
```

## Real-World Examples (HackerOne — paid reports)

42 paid reports. Top bounty: $2,400 (Internet Bug Bounty — Rails Action Pack CVE). Notable: OAuth `redirect_uri` theft paid $750 at GSA Bounty.

**Key patterns from reports:**
- Framework-level CVEs (Rails Action Pack, Rails routing) pay the highest bounties — patch bypasses escalate value further
- OAuth `redirect_uri` open redirects are high-severity because they enable token theft (GSA $750 as high severity)
- Session takeover chains (open redirect + protocol handler abuse) paid $200 at Logitech/Streamlabs
- Unicode/homoglyph bypass (Ideographic Full Stop `。` instead of `.`) defeated Twitter's domain blocklist ($560)
- Host Header Injection as an open redirect vector: `Host: evil.com` causes redirect to attacker domain ($300 at Omise)
- Low-severity bugs on internal/preview endpoints still paid $1,000 at GitLab

## Detection and Defence

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Unvalidated `next`/`url` parameter | Allowlist of allowed redirect destinations; reject external URLs |
| `redirect_uri` in OAuth | Exact-match against pre-registered URIs only |
| Header injection via Host header | Validate `Host` header; use explicit server_name configs |
| Unicode/homoglyph bypass | Normalize URLs to punycode before validation |
| Protocol handler redirect | Block redirects to non-http(s) schemes |

## Referer-header fallback in a go-back redirect helper

Some frameworks' redirect-back-to-where-you-came-from helper (e.g. Laravel's `redirect()->back()`) falls back to the request's `Referer` header when no prior intended-URL is stored in session, and the app never constrains the result to its own origin. Unlike every other open-redirect shape, there is no `?next=`/`?redirect=` parameter to find: a plain GET to any route using this helper (a locale-switch route is a common one) with an attacker-controlled `Referer` header returns that value verbatim in `Location`, and the app may additionally echo a `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` fallback for clients that don't send a Referer.

When hunting for open redirects, don't limit the search to parameter-carrying routes; test any back/return/locale-switch route with a forged `Referer` header even when it takes no redirect-shaped query parameter at all.
