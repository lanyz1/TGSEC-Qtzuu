# Reverse Proxy Misconfigurations

## What it is

Reverse proxies (Nginx, Apache, HAProxy, Traefik, Envoy, Caddy, CDNs) forward client requests to backends and add caching/LB/auth. Misconfigurations - alias traversal, trusting client headers, path-normalization gaps, or `proxy_pass` with user input - yield access-control bypass, file read, SSRF, and SSTI. Related: [[http-request-smuggling]], [[wiki/techniques/web/ssrf]], [[ssti]].

## How it works / where found
The proxy and backend can disagree on the path, the trusted client IP, or where a `location` maps. Attackers exploit that gap. Fingerprint the proxy (`Server`, error pages, header behavior) first.

## Methodology
### Client-IP / trust header spoofing
If the proxy does not strip these, you spoof origin (bypass IP allowlists / rate limits / admin-by-IP):
```
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
True-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1      (Akamai)   X-Forwarded-Host / X-Original-URL / X-Rewrite-URL
```
`X-Original-URL`/`X-Rewrite-URL` can reach paths the proxy ACL blocks (Symfony/IIS/Nginx rewrite cases).

### Nginx off-by-slash (alias traversal)
`location /styles` (no trailing slash) + `alias /path/css/;` -> `/styles../secret.txt` resolves to `/path/css/../secret.txt`. Missing root location -> `/nginx.conf` served from the global `root`.

### Path normalization / ACL bypass
The proxy authorizes one path, the backend normalizes another:
```
/admin..;/   /admin%2f..%2f   /admin%00   /%2e/admin   //admin   /admin/.   /ADMIN
```
`bypass-url-parser` automates these against a protected endpoint.

### Caddy / template SSTI
`templates` interpolating a client header -> Go SSTI:
```bash
curl -H 'Referer: {{readFile "etc/passwd"}}' http://target/
```
`{{env "VAR"}}`, `{{listFiles "/"}}`, `{{readFile "..."}}`.

### proxy_pass SSRF
`proxy_pass http://$host...` or user-controlled upstream -> SSRF into internal services ([[wiki/techniques/web/ssrf]]).

### Apache HTTP Server Confusion Attacks (Orange Tsai, Black Hat USA 2024)
Within one Apache httpd `request_rec`, the fields `r->filename`, `r->handler`, and `r->content_type` can be coerced into each other, and path/DocumentRoot handling is ambiguous. Three classes:
- Filename confusion: modules treat `r->filename` as both a URL and a file path; a `RewriteRule` mapping may access both relative and absolute paths, escaping DocumentRoot (ACL bypass, file read outside web root).
- DocumentRoot confusion: requests resolve against an unexpected root.
- Handler confusion: coercing `r->handler` / `r->content_type` makes a request run through a different handler, leading to SSRF or RCE (for example forcing a file through a scripting handler or `mod_proxy`).

Patched CVEs: CVE-2024-38472 (UNC SSRF), CVE-2024-39573 (mod_rewrite proxy handler), CVE-2024-38477 (mod_proxy DoS), CVE-2024-38476 (backend output to handler execution). Fixed in httpd 2.4.59/2.4.60. Test: fingerprint httpd version, probe `RewriteRule` behaviour, encoded path segments, and handler/content-type coercion.

## HTTP Connection Contamination (first-request routing)
Browsers coalesce a single HTTP/2+ connection across hostnames that share an IP and a TLS cert
(commonly a wildcard `*.example.com`). If the reverse proxy uses first-request routing (routes the
whole connection to the back-end chosen by the first request), later requests to a different vhost
on the coalesced connection are misrouted to the wrong back-end. So a low-value host
(`wordpress.example.com`) with XSS can be reached by a browser request intended for
`secure.example.com`, turning a same-site low-severity bug into a cross-service one without MITM.

Test with coalescing observed in Chrome Network tab / Wireshark:
```javascript
fetch("//sub1.example.com/", {mode:"no-cors", credentials:"include"}).then(() => {
  fetch("//sub2.example.com/", {mode:"no-cors", credentials:"include"})
})
```
Preconditions: shared IP + wildcard/multi-SAN cert + first-request routing. Attack surface widens
under HTTP/3 (relaxes the IP-match requirement). Fix: avoid first-request routing; scope certs.

## Hop-by-hop header abuse
Hop-by-hop headers apply to a single transport hop and must be stripped by a compliant proxy before forwarding. The standard set is `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Transfer-Encoding`, `Upgrade`, `Proxy-Authorization`, `Proxy-Authenticate`. Critically, the `Connection` header lets a client mark ANY additional header as hop-by-hop. A proxy that honours this but fails to re-add or validate the named header creates a bypass: the backend never sees a header it expected.

```http
# Force the proxy to drop X-Forwarded-For so the backend treats the request
# as coming directly from a trusted proxy IP (IP-ACL / geofence bypass)
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: target
Connection: close, X-Forwarded-For
X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4
```

Other headers to nominate as hop-by-hop: session/auth headers the backend trusts (`Cookie`, custom `X-Auth-*`), and cache-key headers for cache poisoning (mark a header the cache keys on so it is stripped after the response is stored). Detection: send a request with and without `Connection: close, <header>` and diff the responses; a behaviour change means the proxy is stripping it. Automate with a Burp Intruder sweep over candidate header names.

## Real-world
Nginx alias traversal and `X-*-URL` ACL bypass are recurring CVEs/bug-bounty finds; CDN+origin path-normalization differences enable auth bypass and request smuggling ([[http-request-smuggling]]).

## Detection and defence
Always trailing-slash `alias`/`location`; define an explicit `/` root; strip/normalize untrusted `X-Forwarded-*`/`X-*-URL` at the edge and only trust them from known proxies; keep proxy + backend on identical path normalization; never put user input in `proxy_pass`; lint config with `gixy`.

## An internal relay's own address poisons the X-Forwarded-For trust chain

Beyond spoofing X-Forwarded-For directly: when a request passes through an INTERNAL forwarding component before reaching the final application, that component may append or overwrite X-Forwarded-For with its OWN internal RFC1918 address as it forwards. If the final internal-IP check reads the LAST element of X-Forwarded-For as closest-hop-therefore-trustworthy, then EVERY external request that happens to route through that internal component, not just requests where an attacker forged the header, ends up trusted as internal, because the last hop really is the internal relay's own address on every single request.

When a service classifies callers as internal/external from a forwarded-IP header, check which component appends the LAST element specifically, not just whether the header can be spoofed by the client; a component-level rewrite anywhere in the chain can grant blanket trust regardless of the true origin.
